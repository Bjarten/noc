###Novel Object Captioner (NOC) ###

While object recognition models can recognize thousands of categories of objects
such as jackals and anteaters, description models cannot compose sentences to
describe these objects correctly in context. Our novel object captioner model
overcomes this problem by building visual description systems
which can describe new objects without pairs of images and sentences about these
objects.
